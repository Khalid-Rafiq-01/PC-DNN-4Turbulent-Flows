# PC-DNN-4Turbulent-Flows
Physics Constrained Deep Neural Network for predicting Mean Turbulent Flows.

**Project Purpose -**
CFD simulations are vital in various fields but can be computationally expensive due to complex equations. To address this, I propose PC-DNN, a physics informed CNN-based model that efficiently approximates solutions for non-uniform steady laminar flows. It learns complete solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations from CFD data, providing a speedup of up to orders of magnitude with low error rates.
